Purpose and Scope

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the cancer prediction system, a machine learning web application designed to predict cancer diagnosis based on medical parameters. The system combines a web-based user interface with a machine learning pipeline to deliver real-time cancer prediction capabilities.

For detailed information about the web interface implementation, see Web Interface. For machine learning pipeline specifics, see Machine Learning Pipeline. For system integration details, see System Integration.


Technology Stack

The system leverages several key technologies:

Frontend Technologies
HTML5: Structure and form handling in 
cancer prediction html.html
1-6
CSS3: Styling with Blueprint.js framework 
cancer prediction html.html
11-2014
JavaScript: Client-side form processing and API integration
Backend Technologies
Web Server: Handles /predict endpoint (implementation not visible in current codebase)
Machine Learning: Python-based model training and prediction via Jupyter notebook
Development Tools
Jupyter Notebook: ML development environment (cancer prediction ipynb.ipynb)
CSV Data Processing: Training dataset handling (cancer.csv)


Key Features

1. Real-time Prediction
The system provides immediate cancer prediction results through a web interface that communicates with a machine learning model via the /predict endpoint.

2. Standardized Data Contract
All system components use a consistent set of 10 medical parameters, ensuring data integrity across the web interface and ML pipeline.

3. Binary Classification
The system performs binary classification to determine malignant (M) or benign (B) cancer diagnosis.

4. Modular Architecture
The separation of concerns between the web interface, backend service, and ML pipeline allows for independent development and deployment.


System Dependencies

The system architecture reveals several key dependencies:

Frontend-Backend Communication: The web interface depends on a backend service to process predictions
Model Training Dependencies: The ML pipeline requires access to the training dataset
Data Contract Alignment: Both frontend and backend must maintain consistency with the 10-parameter data model
Documentation Synchronization: The README serves as the central documentation hub with high modification frequency
